## Data Catalog

This catalogs external data sources this project uses. Note some data will be committed to the repository, while
others are too big and need to be downloaded by running the `download-external.sh` script in the data directory.

### hifld-hospitals.csv

From https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/hospitals.

> This feature class/shapefile contains locations of Hospitals for 50 US states, Washington D.C., US territories of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, and Virgin Islands. The dataset only includes hospital facilities based on data acquired from various state departments or federal sources which has been referenced in the SOURCE field. Hospital facilities which do not occur in these sources will be not present in the database. The source data was available in a variety of formats (pdfs, tables, webpages, etc.) which was cleaned and geocoded and then converted into a spatial database. The database does not contain nursing homes or health centers. Hospitals have been categorized into children, chronic disease, critical access, general acute care, long term care, military, psychiatric, rehabilitation, special, and women based on the range of the available values from the various sources after removing similarities. In this update the TRAUMA field was populated for 172 additional hospitals and helipad presence were verified for all hospitals.

### dh_facility_data.geojson

This was generated by Definitive Health, who is [opening up their data](https://blog.definitivehc.com/news/definitive-healthcare-esri-geomapping-covid19) for COVID-19 relief (thank you!!!). Definitive Health acquired Billian's HealthDATA in 2016; Billian's is the database referenced in the paper [Assessing the capacity of the healthcare system to use additional mechanical ventilators during a large-scale public health emergency](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4636910/) which we are hoping to use to model capacity under different capacity levels (Conventional, Contingency, Crisis).
