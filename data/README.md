### Downloading Data

Note that some data will be committed to
the repository, while others are too big and need to be downloaded by running
the [Download_Data.ipynb](../notebooks/processing/Download_Data.ipynb) notebook.
You must download all the project data to ensure all notebooks run.

## Published Datasets

The 'published' directory contains datasets published by CovidCareMap. These are data that
have been aggregated from various sources, analyzed, processed, inspected for validity and
written to common data formats for easy consumption.

#### Definitive Health (DH) Data

Data generated by Definitive Health, who is [opening up their data](https://blog.definitivehc.com/news/definitive-healthcare-esri-geomapping-covid19) for COVID-19 relief (thank you!!!). Definitive Health acquired Billian's HealthDATA in 2016; Billian's is the database referenced in the paper [Assessing the capacity of the healthcare system to use additional mechanical ventilators during a large-scale public health emergency](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4636910/) which we are hoping to use to model capacity under different capacity levels (Conventional, Contingency, Crisis).

#### Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD)

From https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/hospitals.

> This feature class/shapefile contains locations of Hospitals for 50 US states, Washington D.C., US territories of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, and Virgin Islands. The dataset only includes hospital facilities based on data acquired from various state departments or federal sources which has been referenced in the SOURCE field. Hospital facilities which do not occur in these sources will be not present in the database. The source data was available in a variety of formats (pdfs, tables, webpages, etc.) which was cleaned and geocoded and then converted into a spatial database. The database does not contain nursing homes or health centers. Hospitals have been categorized into children, chronic disease, critical access, general acute care, long term care, military, psychiatric, rehabilitation, special, and women based on the range of the available values from the various sources after removing similarities. In this update the TRAUMA field was populated for 172 additional hospitals and helipad presence were verified for all hospitals.

#### Hospital Referral Region (HRR) Boundaries

Hospital Referral Regions (HRRs) represent regional health care markets for tertiary medical care.

#### Zip Code Convex hulls

Generated by Simon Kassel. TODO: Describe source, generate with notebook.

##### FILES

- **us_zip_codes-convex_hulls.geojson**: The zip code geojson file for the whole US was prohibitively large so we reduced the size by simplifying the polygons into their [convex hulls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull). This dramatically reduced the file size while keeping enough spatial information for the simple task of validating basic location.

##### FILES
