# Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project. There's a lot to do, and the potential to contribute information to the COVID-19 response that could potentially save lives. Every bit counts, and we appreciate you considering pitching in.

## Following Guidelines

This is a quick-pace project that aims to develop useful data in as short of an amount of time as possible.
Because of this, there may need to be quick pivots of focus, and potential contributions pushing in
several directions. Following these guidelines will help make sure we stay coordinated and aligned towards
offering the best possible data to those who need it.

## Requested Contributions

Take a look at the [issue list](https://github.com/daveluo/covid19-healthsystemcapacity/issues) for areas in which you can help out. Work is tagged with GithHub issue labels to organize work by the type of area of interest or ideal skillset. There are also GitHub projects that separate out work that might be useful to check out. For example, if you are someone who can do data science-y things inside a juptyer notebook, check out issues in the [Data Analytics](https://github.com/daveluo/covid19-healthsystemcapacity/projects/2) project. If you are good at researching open datasets that could be useful, check out hte [Data Gathering](https://github.com/daveluo/covid19-healthsystemcapacity/labels/Data%20Gathering) and [Data Request](https://github.com/daveluo/covid19-healthsystemcapacity/labels/Data%20Request) labels. If you are a domain expert or someone who can help inform what information should be produced and how it should be used, you can contribute on [this issue](https://github.com/daveluo/covid19-healthsystemcapacity/issues/19).

Aside from this, please let us know in the [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/covid19-healthsystemcapacity/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge) or in a new issue on ways you want to contribute!

## Getting Started

A number of issues will require thinking through how to coordinate with the project group in order to best accomplish work. If you want to get started on an issue, please comment on that issue and discuss your approach on the Gitter channel or in the issue comments.

If you are going to build Jupyter notebooks for processing data, you can use the Docker setup [described in the README](https://github.com/daveluo/covid19-healthsystemcapacity#running-the-notebooks) for development.

Software contributions may be required to fit to the project standards as they are established in order to increase the ability for new volunteers to get involved and contribute. Make sure to communicate and look for comments on any Pull Requests requesting work to fit into these standards.
